# vertical-teleporter
2 custom-made Quake maps
Vertical Teleporter & Vertical Teleporter II (Glitched) are two custom maps for the 1996 first person shooter Quake. 
The player is spawned just below the ceiling and falls into a teleporter and is sent back up to the ceiling. 
Vertical Teleporter II (Glitched) begins the same way, but a glitch in the level traps the player in the floor. 
The game repeatedly tries and fails to teleport the player back up to the ceiling. 
Each loop repeats for as long as the game is running, potentially forever.
